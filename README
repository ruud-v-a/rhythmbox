About This Fork
===============
This repository is a mirror of the official Rhythmbox repository, with a single
patch applied: it adds support for browsing by album artist, instead of artist,
in the browser view, which is a desired feature when your artist tags contain
e.g. featured artists.

I did submit this patch to the GNOME bugzilla in 2012:
  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678706

There seems to be no intention to merge this patch, neither to support browsing
by album artist in another way. Therefore, I am making a patched version
available as a repository, so that people who do want album artist support can
clone and build without going through the trouble of applying the patch
manually. I intend to add a patched version for every new Rhythmbox release.
For example, the tag `v3.1` is the official Rhythmbox 3.1, and
`v3.1-album-artist` is the patched version.

What follows below is the original readme.
